# CV compilation

Currently this only compiles the number of publications using the csv from google scholar. 


# STEP 1: 
1. Go to your google scholar
2. Import the csv with all your publications
3. Remove all items that are not publications (e.g. conference proceedings)
4. save the csv in the `1_data` folder
This will be concatenated with the 'citations_core_do_not_erase '
5. A message will ask to double check if all entries are ok in the file citations_core_do_not_erase.csv that will be overwritten
